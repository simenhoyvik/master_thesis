# Master Thesis

This master thesis delves into the exploration of neural ranking models, with a particular focus on architectures based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The primary objective of the thesis is to train these ranking models using textual data extracted from systematic reviews. The purpose is to develop a tool that can assist researchers in conducting systematic reviews by prioritizing the most relevant studies, thus eliminating the need to screen non-relevant studies in the initial stages.
